# GiftShuffler
Take a CSV of participants and generate text files for blind gift giving.

We have this thing where someone in the family sets up a secret gift exchange for Christmas. We enjoy it, but the organizer always knows all of the giving pairs, eliminating some of the surprise. This little toy reads a list of names from a CSV and matches up some random assignments for gift giving. It then writes out a series of text files to send to the participants. DON'T OPEN THE FILES if you don't want to know the details.

The script checks for self giving, but no other validation (spouses, siblings, etc.) is assumed. Everyone is fair game as a recipient except for the giver. That would just be silly.

Have fun!
